# C-and-API

C# and API. API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of commands, which interfaces the programs with the processors. 

API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of commands, which interfaces the programs with the processors. The most commonly used set of external procedures are those that make up Microsoft Windows itself. The Windows API contains thousands of functions, structures, and constants that you can declare and use in your projects. Those functions are written in the C language, however, so they must be declared before you can use them. The declarations for DLL procedures can become fairly complex. Specifically to C# it is more complex than VB. You can use API viewer tool to get API function declaration but you have to keep in mind the type of parameter which is different in C#.

Most of the advanced languages support API programming. The Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC) framework encapsulates a large portion of the Win32 (API). ODBC API Functions are useful for performing fast operations on database. With API your application can request lower-level services to perform on computer's operating system. As API supports thousands of functionality from simple Message Box to Encryption or Remote computing, developers should know how to implement API in their program.
